# IINOBROBO + MESSAGESITE BACKEND

### PURPOSE
This was created as a Discord bot and messaging site hybrid. Because they have cross-communication between the website and the Discord channel, they are both built into the same file.
Registerring slash commands is in a second file so I don't have to reregister them whenever I change the main file.

### COMPATABILITY PROBLEMS
To avoid copyright issues, some files have been removed. Certain commands and pages (ones that reference files in the content directory) will not work without said files. Either supply those files or remove those commands if you don't want issues.
The majority of features will still work without these files.
